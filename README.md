# smf_contracts

Contracts, DSL, and shared codegen interfaces used across SMF modules (routing, DI, code generation).

Most users will consume these contracts indirectly through SMF modules and the SMF CLI.

## Use with SMF CLI
Use the SMF CLI for scaffolding and configuration; this package is used under the hood by SMF modules.
